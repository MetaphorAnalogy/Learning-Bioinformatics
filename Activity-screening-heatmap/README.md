## **Project:** Creating a visualisation for table with protein activity values.

**Description:** This project generates heatmap to visualize screening for activity of 11 proteins overproduced at 2 different induction temperatures with the reactions cariied at 3 different temperatures.
The heatmaps use a common color scale for consistency, making it easy to compare results across datasets. My aim was to visualize this data in appealing way, so that the wide range of values won't mask low numbers. Additionally, I wanted to minimize the noise of many 0 values which was buzzing from the data in the table format.
